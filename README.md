# Geocluster

Geocluster takes an array of geographic coordinates and converts them into clusters of different size and weight.

Example usage with Google Maps:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
  gem 'geocluster'
```

And then execute:

```shell
  $ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```shell
  $ gem install geocluster
```

## Usage

You can cluster coordinates using

```ruby
  Geocluster.cluster_coordinates(coordinates, options = {})
```
    
and passing it an array of the coordinates you would like to cluster. For example:

```ruby
  Geocluster.cluster_coordinates(
    [[52.5200065, 13.404954], [52.5094156, 13.4533962], [52.3941887, 13.072691]]
  )
  # => [{ :coordinates => [52.3941887, 13.072691000000003], :count => 3}]
  # Returns the position of your new cluster associated
  # with the number of coordinates it consumed.
```

You can also pass the following options (default values are assigned below):

```ruby
  options = {
    :precision => 3, # the higher, the finer the clusters will be
    :limit => nil,   # max number of returned clusters; set to nil to get all
    :nucleus => true # if true, centers clusters over where most of its coordinates are;
                     # if false, centers clusters geographically among all coordinates it absorbs
  }
```

Example usage:

```ruby
  Geocluster.cluster_coordinates(
    [[52.5200065, 13.404954], [52.5094156, 13.4533962], [52.3941887, 13.072691]],
    precision: 5,
    limit: 2,
    nucleus: false
  )
```

Clustering may come in handy for displaying a myriad of coordinates on a map.
